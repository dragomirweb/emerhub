## Information

- When a user visits the form a anonimous user is created using firebase auth
- based on the user a document is added in the users collections to achive data persistence 
- using the databse. 

Things I could of added :
thottle the requests to firebase
calculate the progress using the endpoint ( but i didn't see the need since that could be achived and should be 
done in the frontend
)
